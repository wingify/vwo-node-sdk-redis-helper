If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
Ensure the test suite passes.
Make sure your code lints.

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same Apache 2.0 License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

Report bugs using GitHub issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Note: Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

A quick summary and/or background
Steps to reproduce
Be specific!
Give sample code if you can.
What you expected would happen
What actually happens
Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
Use a Consistent Coding Style
We use prettier for auto-formatting and consistent coding style among developers.
